# ImageSliceViewer3D
3D image or volume slice viewer for jupyter notebook.

I was working on a project with 3D volumetric images in jupyter, and I couldn't find any way to easily view the 3D images in jupyter notebooks. I found many solutions to view slices of images using python, but most of them did not work with jupyter. So here is a way to interactively visualize slices of a volume or 3D image in jupyter or ipython.

Please note ImageSliceViewer3D requires numpy, matplotlib and ipywidgets.
